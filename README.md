# Weather Dashboard  

## Purpose

To be able to check the weather for today and for 5 days ahead easily.


## Usage

 The page will load initially with a default city of Conshohocken, PA. Users can simply enter a city name in the input bar and click the blue search button to see current weather and 5-day forecast information for that city. Once users have searched for a different city, those will show up in the Recent Searches section of the page. When the user refreshes or returns to the page at a later time, the page will load and present weather data for the most recent search.
